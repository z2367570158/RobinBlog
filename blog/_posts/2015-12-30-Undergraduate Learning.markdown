##  Gomoku Chess game with AI in Android by JAVA

Gomoku, also called Gobang or Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. The rule is a little bit like the game Connect Four. The first player who gets five notes in a row, a column or in a diagonal wins the game.

The AI is implemented by ranking all available positions. Improved by saving all the failed game information and changing the factor of rankings.

##  Mathematical Contest In Data Modeling

> Evaluate the Colleges Base on ROI

1. Using R type-clustering method to calculate the correlation level of factors.

2. To calculate the impact of each factor and the result of established goals model, we use the Principal Component Analysis(PCA).

3. According to the related variables of the principal component, we find earnings and debt largely control the fluctuation. Using these variables, we build a model of ROI(return on investment), and all colleges are ranked by it.

##  Undergraduate Final Project

> Gene Regulatory Network Constructing Plugin based on Cytoscape

Based on the Cytoscape platform, designed and implemented a convenient and intuitive gene regulatory network constructing and visualizing plug-in called CytoGRN. The plugin integrates 5 typical gene regulatory network constructing algorithms as GENIE3, PCA-CMI, PCA-PMI, CN, Multugranger. At the same time, CytoGRN also provides the visualization of the constructing results, where the gene regulatory networks are intuitively displayed as network topology, which facilitates further research.
